A plugin for GKrellM, that let's you define timers and stopwatches.


Prerequisites:
===============
You do have a recent GKrellM-2, don't you?
You also need the header (include) files for building.
This release aims at GTK-2.0 users. Please uses the 1.1 release for
prior GTK versions or the 1.0 release for prior GKrellM versions.


Compiling:
===========

* For linux: just run the normal 'make'.
* For freebsd: run 'make freebsd'.


Installing:
===========
Running 'make install-user' will place the plugin in your current home
directory under ~/.gkrellm/plugins.
Running 'make install' as superuser will place the plugin under
/usr/share/gkrellm/plugins. You can also manually place the resulting
gkrellm_timers.so under ~/.gkrellm/plugins. After restarting gkrellm, you
should be able to enable it in the gkrellm plugins configuration menu.


Troubleshooting:
================
If you have trouble compiling the plugin. Make sure you have gtk 2.0 and 
gkrellm >= 2.0.x and you've installed the gkrellm header files in
/usr/include/gkrellm or /usr/local/include/gkrellm. If you have placed the
header files in some other dir, edit GKRELLM_INCLUDE in the Makefile

 
Bugs:
=====
You can suspend your computer and the timers will continue,
when you shut gkrellm down all timers will be reset though.
This is not a bug and gkrellms problem not the plugins.

I do consider this version stable.
please mail any problems/bugs to me...


Tested on:
==========
SuSE Linux 7.1 thru 9.2
Debian SID
FreeBSD  4.0 Release
RedHad Linux 6.1
Gentoo
